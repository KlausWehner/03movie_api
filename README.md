This is a server-side component of a “movies” web application, that will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

The app was built using the MERN stack:
    MongoDB - document database
    Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
    React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
    Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server
